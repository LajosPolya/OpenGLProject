If a GameObject is redrawn in a difference Position (crates, or grass objects) then data should not be sent to the Shader a second time.
Each GameObject should have a unique Id which is checked before data is sent to the Shader to improve performance.


Have a game played on a randomly Perlin Noise generated map.
The Player can move around in the world, but if the Player 
holds a button (like ctrl) and pushes the move button then 
it will also place a block down in that direction and move 
the Player onto the block it just moved.

This can make a really fast paced game where the player 
has to collect objects around the map.
