# OpenGLProject
OpenGL Graphics Engine

I'm writing this project to improve myself as a programer.
Key goals :
Learn the OpenGL API
Learn new algorithms common in the game/graphics engines
Improve knowledge of C++
Improve knowledge of Object Oriented Principles
Improve Software Development Principles (such as techiniques to develop well written code)
Improve knowledge of 3D math (such as vector math and matrix operations) 

This project is written in C++ using the OpenGL API.

Notable Features : 
Implemented 3D Perlin Noise coupled with multithreading to allow for continous terrain generation
Implemented Phong Shading Model in GLSL (invloves the use of diffuse and specular textures)
Lights can be placed dynamically at run time
Collision Detection
